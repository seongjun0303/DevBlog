          <h1>ALL FOR ONE, AND ONE FOR ALL</h1>
          <p>The idea for a bookstore that caters to ALL readers came to our founder John Doe in 1977, when he first stepped foot in a bookstore and found that there was a limited selection of titles. After visiting several other stores, John came to a dead end in his search. Tired and frustrated, John envisioned his idea of the perfect bookstore, thus beginning the journey of Imagine Bookstore.</p>
          <p>In its single location in Athens, Georgia, Imagine Bookstore contains at least one of EVERY genre known to man. Imagine Bookstore has the largest literature selection in the Southeast, with over 28,000 total titles, including novels, short stories, poems, and more. Whether you are a novice reader or a professional page-turner, 4 years old to 94 years old, Imagine Bookstore has the perfect read for you.</p>
          <p>Inspired by his favorite book,<i>The Three Musketeers</i>, John chose to make our store live and breathe through the famous quote "All for One, and One for All." Although we have one location, all of us here at Imagine Bookstore strive to help find one's journey through literature, in a place where one can find all they could ever<span id="imagine"> IMAGINE.</span></p>
